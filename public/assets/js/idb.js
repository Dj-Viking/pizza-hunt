// 2. the version of the database. By default, it starts at 1.

/**
 * Now the getAll.onsuccess event will execute after the .getAll() method completes successfully. 
 * At that point, the getAll variable we created above it will have a .result property that's an array 
 * of all the data we retrieved from the new_pizza object store.

If there's data to send, we send that array of data we just retrieved to the server at the POST 
/api/pizzas endpoint. Fortunately, the Mongoose .create() method we use to create a pizza can handle either single objects or an 
array of objects, so no need to create another route and controller method to handle this one event.

On a successful server interaction, we'll access the object store one more time and empty it, 
as all of the data that was there is now in the database.

Now let's test this out. First, navigate up to the request.onsuccess event handler we created earlier 
and uncomment the call to uploadPizza(). With this uncommented, we'll check to see if we're online every time 
this app opens and upload any remnant pizza data, just in case we left the app with items still in the local IndexedDB database. 
That way, users won't have to worry about staying in the app to ensure the data is eventually uploadedâ€”it'll 
do that for them next time they return!
